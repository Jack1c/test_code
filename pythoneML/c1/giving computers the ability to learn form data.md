##  The Three different types of machine learning

###  Supervised  Learning
Learn a model from labeled training data to make predictions about unseen of futer data.

+ Classification for predictions class labels(分类)

  predict(预测)the categorical(绝对的) class labels of new instances based on past observations.

+ Regression(回归) Analysis

  prediction continuous outcomes(预测连续的输出值),which is also called regression analysis(回归分析)


###  Unsupervised  Learning(非监督学习)
Deal with unlabeled data or data of unkonwn structure,
explore the structure of data to extract(提取)meaningful
imformation withod the guidaces of a known outcome variable or reward(回报) function

### Reinforcement Learning(强化学习)

Develop a system(agent) that improves(提高) its prerformance(性能) based on interactions(交互) with the environment.
